# Employee_Promotion_Prediction
Objective: To develop a machine learning model that predicts which employees are likely to be promoted within the next year based on historical employee data.
# Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and outliers in the dataset.
Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Performed feature scaling and normalization if necessary.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explored the dataset to understand its distribution, correlations, and patterns.
Visualized key features and relationships using data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
# Feature Selection:
Identified and selected relevant features for the prediction model.
Used feature importance techniques (e.g., feature importance scores from a random forest classifier).
# Model Building:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting).
Trained the model on the training data.
Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Created confusion matrices and ROC curves for a comprehensive assessment.

# Achieved an accuracy of [accuracy] and a precision of [precision] in predicting employee promotions.
Identified key factors contributing to employee promotions, providing actionable insights for HR decision-makers.
Improved HR decision-making by enabling early identification of high-potential employees.
