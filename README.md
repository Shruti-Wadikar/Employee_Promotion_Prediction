# Employee_Promotion_Prediction
# Objective: To develop a machine learning model that predicts which employees are likely to be promoted within the next year based on historical employee data.

A machine learning model to predict employee promotions based on historical data. This project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model building using classification techniques. The AdaBoost classifier achieved an impressive 92% accuracy, providing actionable insights for HR decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature encoding & scaling
Explored dataset distribution, correlations, and key insights with EDA
Selected relevant features using importance scores
Built and fine-tuned classification models, with AdaBoost as the best performer
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC
ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
EDA (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
This project enhances HR analytics by identifying high-potential employees for promotion, improving workforce planning.
